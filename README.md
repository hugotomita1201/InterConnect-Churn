# InterConnect Churn Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a model that can predict the churn of customers so that InterConnect can offer promotions and discounts to those who are predicted to leave.

## Conclusions
We were able to achieve an AUC-ROC score of 0.844 which was above the threshold of .75. This was done with a cat boost model. 

With this model, Interconnect will theoretically be able to implement marketing strategies towards customers who are likely to leave their service.
